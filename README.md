<p align="center"><sub>Follow a real agent research session. Open a question to inspect its experiments, evidence, and next steps.</sub></p>

## Research you can follow

| Follow the reasoning | Inspect the evidence |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nested research spaces.** Keep the main story readable; open containers for subquestions, alternatives, and deeper experiments. | **Original results.** Inspect retained files, command output, configuration, and comparisons beside the graph. |
| **Work across conversations.** A portable Skill lets multiple agent chats contribute to the same experiment. Copy a node reference to discuss a specific step. | **Visible progress and cost.** See completed, paused, excluded, and failed work, with captured timing and available Token usage. |

Your agent chooses the research approach. ExpObserver preserves how it develops, including negative results and unfinished questions. Records, revision history, and evidence stay on your computer.

The workspace above comes from a real research session. [Open the same example →](examples/har-study/README.md)

## Quick start

### Ask your agent

Send this instruction to your agent:

> Install and start ExpObserver and its Skill by following https://github.com/EuanTop/exp-observer/blob/main/INSTALL.md.

### Or start it yourself

1. [Download **exp-observer.zip**](https://github.com/EuanTop/exp-observer/releases/latest/download/exp-observer.zip) and extract it.
2. Launch **start.bat** on Windows or **start.command** on macOS. On Linux, run `python3 start.py`.
3. Open **Connect Agent**, connect your research directory, and copy the instruction into your agent chat.

Requires **Python 3.10+**. The ready-to-run package needs no Node.js, pip packages, account, or model API key. [Installation & upgrades →](INSTALL.md)

Then give your agent a research task:

> Use the ExpObserver Skill for experiment `my-study`. Investigate my question, retain the evidence, and keep the experiment up to date as you work.

The Skill can wake the installed platform when it is closed. Records queue locally if the service is unavailable.

The interface defaults to **English**. Choose **简体中文** in the language selector; your choice is remembered. In compact windows, open **More tools** to find it.

Select a node and choose **Copy reference**. Paste it into any agent chat and add your question. The reference carries the experiment and node identity, so the agent can read the latest context.
